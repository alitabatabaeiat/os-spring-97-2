Introduction
Have you sever seen a lava lamp? They might look complicated, but you can make your own using common kitchen supplies. Try this activity to find out how!

Background
If you look around your kitchen, there are probably a lot of different liquids, including water, juice, milk and oil. Many of these liquids have different properties that you can see, feel and taste. For example, milk is opaque and white whereas water is transparent and clear, and oil has a “slimy” texture that makes it difficult to clean if you spill it.

Each liquid also has other properties that might not be so obvious because you can’t “see” them easily. For example, they all have different densities (the amount of mass per unit of volume). Many common household liquids such as juice and milk have a density very close to that of water, so you might not notice a difference. Oil, however, has a lower density than water, meaning it can float on top of water. (It is buoyant.) You can see this if you try putting a few drops of oil in a glass of water—they will float on the surface.

Liquids are all made up of molecules that have different chemical properties. Some molecules are polar, meaning they have unbalanced electrical charges. These molecules tend to mix with one another better than they mix with nonpolar molecules, which have evenly distributed charges. You can observe this if you try mixing different liquids together. For example, it’s very easy to mix together juice and milk or water and food coloring. But if you try mixing water and oil—even if you stir vigorously—the liquids “want” to stay separated.

What can you do with all this information? In this project you’ll use it to make your own lava lamp!
