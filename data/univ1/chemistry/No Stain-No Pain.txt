Introduction
It’s happened to most of us: You wear a brand new shirt, and in the middle of lunch you get a giant ketchup stain right in the middle of it—or maybe it’s peanut butter or spaghetti sauce. Whatever the stain, it’s always ugly and can be tricky to remove. Did you know there are many different kinds of stains and each requires different types of cleaning to get it out? If you try to clean a mustard stain using shower cleaner, for example, you probably won’t get good results. Why does the type of stain matter? In today’s activity we’ll explore a few different kinds of stains—and try to determine the best method for cleaning them!
Background
There are many different types of household cleaners because there are many different types of messes to clean up! Stains can be roughly grouped into four different categories: enzymatic (such as grass or blood stains); oxidizable (stains such as coffee or tea), greasy (butter or oil) and particulate (your typical, run-of-the-mill dirt stains).

Enzymatic stains are generally the result of protein action, and therefore enzyme cleaners will help break down these proteins into smaller, soluble (able to dissolve in water) chunks. Oxidizable stains are usually brightly colored, such as juice. These stains are removed by using a bleaching agent, for example, hydrogen peroxide. These oxidizing agents break down the color-causing components of chemical structures so that the stain becomes invisible! In the case of greasy stains the best cleaners are usually surfactants. Surfactants surround the greasy stain and expose the water soluble sections of the stain-causing chemical structure helping it to dissolve in water and wash away. Finally particulate stains are usually cleaned with compounds called builders. These builders help remove positive metal ions such as those of calcium and magnesium, breaking down tough dirt stains and allowing them to be washed away.
